INTRODUCTION

Ted's Parser Compiler (tpc) is yet another tool for generating LALR(1)
parsers.  Unlike yacc and bison, tpc does not generate parser.
Instead it generates the tables that a LALR(1) parser uses to decide
when to shift and how to reduce the tokens it is given.  This makes it 
possible to build reentrant parsers, the motivation for its
construction.
