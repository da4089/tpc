Overview of changes in tpc-0.5.1

* Added various files that make a distribution complete, including
  README, AUTHORS and a man page.

* Error messages now attempt to be more helpful about explaining what
  went wrong (better than state=x, type=y).

* Lots of tweaks suggested by various compilers.

* Implemented the `-o' and `-q' command-line options to specify an
  output file and turn off warnings and error messages.

* Major rewrite and name reform.  The code in grammar.c is still
  confusing but hopefully less so than it was before.
